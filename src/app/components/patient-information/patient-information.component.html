        <ul>
          <li>Angina </li>
          <li>Aortic Stenosis and other valvular conditions </li>
          <li>Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and other cardiac arrhythmias   </li>
          <li>Heart Failure</li>
          <li>High Blood Pressure</li>
          <li>High Cholesterol</li>
          <li>Heart Block</li>
          <li>Cardiomyopathy</li>
          <li>Vasovagal Syncope</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dr McKavanagh is happy to answer any questions that you may have. For information about any additional conditions not featured within the site, please contact us for more information.

        <h4>Investigations and Management</h4>
        <p>To help with diagnosis, some cardiology tests may be necessary. These may include</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Electrocardiogram (ECG) (an electrical tracing of the rhythm heart) </li>
          <li>Echocardiography (an ultrasound of the heart)</li>
          <li>24HR Blood Pressure Monitoring (a device to assess blood pressure over 24 hours)</li>
          <li>Exercise Stress Test (EST) (a treadmill test to assess your ECG and Blood Pressure when the heart is stressed)</li>
          <li>Coronary Angiography (an invasive dye test to assess coronary arteries for blockages)</li>
          <li>Ambulatory ECG (a monitoring device to assess the heart rhythm over a period of time)</li>
          <li>Stress Echocardiography (an ultrasound test to assess the heart when it is stressed)</li>
          <li>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (a specialised scan of the heart that is useful for assessing the heart muscle)</li>
          <li>Cardiac computerised tomography (CT) (a specialised scan of the heart that is useful for assessing coronary arteries for calcium and narrowing)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For many patients, no further treatment is required after the initial comprehensive assessment. However, some patients do require:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Coronary Angioplasty/Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)/ Stenting
          <li>Pacemaker</li>
          <li>Implantable Defibrillator </li>
          <li>Pressure Wire Testing</li>
          <li>Electrophysiology Studies</li>
          <li>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting</li>
          <li>Valve surgery/intervention</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Prices</h4>
